##Geolocation Analytics

This app logs geolocation updates in combination with wifi and cellular stats. Geolocation accuracy depends on a number of factors, so we use this app to investigate the impact of bad network connections on location accuracy, for example.

####Please note
This app uses private API and is not intended for app store submission but rather for testing purposes.

####Concenpt
This app logs cellular, wifi and location data to a txt file as soon as location updates are requested and stops logging when location updates are stopped accordingly. These text files can be sent via email to whomever this may concern. Note: logging to a txt file might not be the optimal solution, this might and should change with the evolution of this app.

**This app is in its' experimental stages, so don't expect too much yet ;)**
